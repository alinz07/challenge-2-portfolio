## **What and Why**
The purpose of this projects is to create my deployed portfolio so that hiring managers can review samples of my work and assess if my knowledge and skills are a good fit for the position. I expect the purpose of this project to evolve with my portfolio. This projects uses strictly html and advanced css.
## Challenge Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

## **How and Why**
* Comments, semantic elements and alt text were added to improve accessibility. This will increase the potential consumer base, improve code readability, improve the websites position in search engine results (SEO) and help avoid accessibility lawsuits.
* In order to clean up the code, html classes were modified to consolidate CSS rules and some CSS rules were removed.
* HTML elements that were missing IDs were given them so that navigation links in the header will bring a consumer to the correct seciton. This also increases accessibility.

## **Things I learned**
Html and css comments significantly increase code readability.

## **What makes this project stand out?**
The logical flow of the html and css, the comments describing every section's code and consistent spacing/indentation make this web application beautiful.
